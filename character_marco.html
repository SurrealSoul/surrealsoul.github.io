            <h2>The Business Rival</h2>
            <p>A ruthless corporate raider who Cornelius nearly bankrupted. He claims he's here to "pay his respects."</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <h3>His Secret</h3>
                <p>He wasn't invited. He paid the groundskeeper to let him in. He's been trying to find Cornelius's hidden ledger to ruin his company.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Marco Varelli earned his nickname "The Shark" through decades of ruthless corporate takeovers and business dealings. He's known for circling wounded companies like a predator, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Five years ago, Cornelius outmaneuvered him in a deal that cost Marco millions and his reputation on Wall Street.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Marco's business empire has been slowly crumbling since his defeat by Cornelius. He believes that Cornelius keeps a secret ledger detailing illegal business practices that could be used to destroy the Crimson corporation from the inside. With Cornelius dead, Marco hopes to find this ledger and use it to reclaim his lost fortune and reputation.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>Though uninvited, Marco gained access to the cabin by bribing Captain Jack, the groundskeeper. He's been secretly searching the property for Cornelius's hidden safe or office where the ledger might be kept. His business background means he knows exactly what to look for and how to cover his tracks.</p>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Claims to be paying respects despite being a known enemy of Cornelius</li>
                <li>Has been seen prowling the cabin at odd hours</li>
                <li>Carries lock-picking tools disguised as business accessories</li>
                <li>Was caught trying to access Cornelius's home office</li>
                <li>Shows no genuine grief about Cornelius's death</li>
                <li>Has been asking pointed questions about business documents</li>
                <li>Was overheard promising Captain Jack more money for "additional services"</li>
            </ul>
