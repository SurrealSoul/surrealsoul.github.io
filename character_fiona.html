            <h2>The Journalist</h2>
            <p>A cunning investigative reporter who snuck in pretending to be a cousin. She's hunting for a story.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <h3>Her Secret</h3>
                <p>She believes Cornelius was responsible for her brother's "accidental" death years ago and is here for revenge, not just a story.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Fiona Gable has built her career on exposing the dark secrets of the wealthy and powerful. Known for her tenacity and willingness to go to any length for a story, she's taken down politicians, CEOs, and celebrities. But this case is personal - she's convinced that Cornelius Crimson orchestrated her brother's death and covered it up.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Seven years ago, Fiona's younger brother Danny was killed in what was ruled an "accidental" fall from a construction site owned by Crimson Industries. Fiona has spent years investigating and believes she's uncovered evidence that Cornelius ordered Danny's death to prevent him from exposing safety violations. She came to the cabin seeking both justice and a final confession.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>Fiona infiltrated the gathering by posing as a distant cousin, using fake identification and a carefully constructed backstory. Her investigative skills make her adept at finding evidence and exploiting weaknesses. She's been secretly recording conversations and photographing documents throughout her stay.</p>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Has been asking very specific questions about Cornelius's business dealings</li>
                <li>Was caught photographing documents in the study</li>
                <li>Carries professional recording equipment disguised as personal items</li>
                <li>Shows an unusual knowledge of the family's history for a "distant cousin"</li>
                <li>Has been taking extensive notes about everyone's behavior</li>
                <li>Was overheard saying "Danny, this is for you" while looking at Cornelius's portrait</li>
                <li>Seems more interested in gathering information than mourning</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </main>

        <p>The pen is mightier than the sword... but sometimes revenge requires more direct action.</p>
