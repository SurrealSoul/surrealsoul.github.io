            <h2>The Bodyguard</h2>
            <p>Eleanor's personal bodyguard, hired after she claimed Cornelius was "unstable." He never leaves her side.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <h3>His Secret</h3>
                <p>He is Eleanor's secret lover. He would do anything to protect her and ensure their future together.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Blake Riley is a former military special forces operative who transitioned into private security work after leaving the army. He was hired by Eleanor six months ago, officially to protect her from Cornelius's increasingly erratic behavior, but their professional relationship quickly became something much more personal and dangerous.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Blake is deeply in love with Eleanor and knows about the prenuptial agreement that leaves her penniless unless Cornelius dies under unnatural circumstances. He's also been promised a substantial sum from Eleanor's inheritance once she receives it. His military training makes him capable of carrying out a perfect murder, and his devotion to Eleanor makes him willing to do anything to secure their future together.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>As a bodyguard, Blake has training in stealth, combat, and tactical operations. He knows how to kill quietly and efficiently, and his presence in the cabin is expected and unquestioned. His close relationship with Eleanor also means he knows intimate details about Cornelius's habits and vulnerabilities that could be exploited.</p>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Has been exchanging meaningful looks and subtle touches with Eleanor</li>
                <li>Shows no genuine grief about Cornelius's death</li>
                <li>Has been unusually alert and watchful, even for a bodyguard</li>
                <li>Was seen outside the study early in the morning, claiming to be "checking security"</li>
                <li>Carries various weapons and tools that could be used for more than just protection</li>
                <li>Has been coaching Eleanor on what to say to other guests</li>
                <li>Seems more concerned about protecting Eleanor's reputation than solving the murder</li>
            </ul>
