    <h1>Eleanor Crimson (ID: Q2)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Widow</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> She is actually Lorelei Vance, a wanted con artist from Chicago. Officer Dunn may
            be hot on your
            case.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> The pre-nuptial agreement she signed was ironclad - she would receive nothing if
            they divorced or if
            Cornelius died of natural causes. However, if he were to die under "unnatural circumstances," she would
            inherit a substantial portion of his estate. Her secret relationship with Blake Riley, her bodyguard,
            gives her additional motivation to secure their future together.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims she was sleeping in the master bedroom. She says she took a sleeping pill at
            10 PM and didn't wake
            up until the scream.</li>
    </ul>
