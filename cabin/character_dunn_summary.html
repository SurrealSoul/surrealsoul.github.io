    <h1>Officer Dunn (ID: X7)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The "Local Cop"</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> He's not a cop. He's a private investigator hired by Cornelius. He discovered that
            "Eleanor" is
            actually a wanted fraudster named Lorelei Vance, and he was planning to turn her in... for a
            price.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Cornelius hired Dunn weeks ago to investigate several of his guests, suspecting
            that some of them were
            planning something against him. Dunn was supposed to gather evidence and report back, but when he
            learned about Cornelius's plans to cut certain people out of his will, he realized that his client's
            death might be more profitable than his continued employment.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims he was patrolling the perimeter. He says he was checking for any signs of
            forced entry.</li>
    </ul>
