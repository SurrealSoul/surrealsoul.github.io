            <h2>The Maid</h2>
            <p>A new, quiet maid who seems terrified of everyone. She was seen weeping in the hallway this morning.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Her Secret</h3>
                    <p>She isn't a maid. She's the illegitimate daughter of Cornelius, here to claim her birthright. She
                        has a locket with his picture in it.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Genevieve grew up in poverty, raised by a single mother who worked as a seamstress. For 22 years, she
                believed her father had died before she was born. Only recently did her dying mother reveal the truth:
                her father was Cornelius Crimson, who had abandoned them when he learned of the pregnancy. She's spent
                months planning how to approach him and claim her place in the family.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Genevieve came to the cabin hoping to reveal herself as Cornelius's daughter and claim her inheritance.
                She took the job as a maid to get close to him and find the right moment to present evidence of their
                relationship. However, when she finally worked up the courage to confront him, he cruelly rejected her,
                claiming she was just another gold-digger trying to scam money from him.</p>

                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>As a maid, Genevieve has access to every room in the cabin and knows everyone's routines. She's
                        been observing the family dynamics and learning about each guest's secrets while cleaning their
                        rooms. Her invisibility as "just the help" means people often don't notice her presence or guard
                        their conversations around her.</p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims she was cleaning the upstairs hallway. She says she was too terrified of the storm to sleep.</p>

                        <li>Clutches a gold locket that she keeps hidden under her uniform</li>
                        <li>Seems to know more about the family history than a new employee should</li>
                        <li>Was seen lingering outside Cornelius's study, apparently gathering courage</li>
                        <li>Has been asking other staff members pointed questions about inheritance laws</li>
                        <li>Bears a strong physical resemblance to Cornelius, particularly around the eyes</li>
                        <li>Was overheard whispering "He has to acknowledge me" repeatedly</li>

                        <li>I saw <strong>Lily</strong> walking in the hall.</li>
                        <li>I saw <strong>Antoine</strong> sneaking out of the Master Study hallway just minutes before
                            the body
                            was found. He looked frantic.</li>


                        <li>I noticed that <strong>Officer Dunn</strong> his radio doesn't seem to connect to any actual
                            police dispatch.</li>
