            <h2>The Bodyguard</h2>
            <p>Eleanor's personal bodyguard, hired after she claimed Cornelius was "unstable." He never leaves her side.
            </p>

            <div class="secret">
                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>His Secret</h3>
                    <p>He is Eleanor's secret lover. He would do anything to protect her and ensure their future
                        together.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Blake Riley is a former military special forces operative who transitioned into private security work
                after leaving the army. He was hired by Eleanor six months ago, officially to protect her from
                Cornelius's increasingly erratic behavior, but their professional relationship quickly became something
                much more personal and dangerous.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Blake is deeply in love with Eleanor and knows about the prenuptial agreement that leaves her penniless
                unless Cornelius dies under unnatural circumstances. He's also been promised a substantial sum from
                Eleanor's inheritance once she receives it. His military training makes him capable of carrying out a
                perfect murder, and his devotion to Eleanor makes him willing to do anything to secure their future
                together.</p>

            <div class="opportunity-section" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <button onclick="revealOpportunity(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #c79a00; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>As a bodyguard, Blake has training in stealth, combat, and tactical operations. He knows how to
                        kill quietly and efficiently, and his presence in the cabin is expected and unquestioned. His
                        close relationship with Eleanor also means he knows intimate details about Cornelius's habits
                        and vulnerabilities that could be exploited.</p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims he was doing security rounds outside. He says he saw footprints in the snow but thought they were
                from an animal.</p>



            <div class="suspicious-section" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <button onclick="revealSuspicious(this)"

                    Suspicious Behavior</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Has been exchanging meaningful looks and subtle touches with Eleanor</li>
                        <li>Shows no genuine grief about Cornelius's death</li>
                        <li>Has been unusually alert and watchful, even for a bodyguard</li>
                        <li>Was seen outside the study early in the morning, claiming to be "checking security"</li>
                        <li>Carries various weapons and tools that could be used for more than just protection</li>
                        <li>Has been coaching Eleanor on what to say to other guests</li>
                        <li>Seems more concerned about protecting Eleanor's reputation than solving the murder</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Denials</h3>
            <p>I was patrolling the corridor outside the study from 2:45 AM to 3:30 AM. No one entered or left,
                certainly not the Chef. <strong>Genevieve</strong> must be mistaken... or lying.</p>

                    Accusations</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Accusations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I stood guard while <strong>Eleanor</strong> and Cornelius argued. <strong>Arthur</strong>
                            was
                            eavesdropping.</li>
                        <li>I saw <strong>Jack</strong> examining footprints near the study window.</li>
                        <li>I saw <strong>Officer Dunn</strong> watching <strong>Julian</strong> on the porch.</li>

                        <li>I noticed that <strong>"Captain" Jack</strong> can't explain why the phone lines failed at
                            the exact same time.</li>
                        <li>I noticed that <strong>Chloe Bishop</strong> keeps checking her phone for updates about her
                            mother's condition.</li>
                        <li>Know's Officer Dunn is not a stripper
                        <li>
                    </ul>
