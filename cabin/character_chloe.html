            <h2>The Personal Assistant</h2>
            <p>Cornelius's efficient and overworked assistant. She handled all his appointments and correspondence.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Her Secret</h3>
                    <p>She was secretly siphoning money from Cornelius's accounts to pay for her mother's medical care.
                        He found out yesterday.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Chloe has been Cornelius's personal assistant for three years, managing everything from his schedule to
                his personal correspondence. She's known for her efficiency and discretion, but recent family troubles
                have pushed her to desperate measures. Her mother's battle with cancer has drained her savings and
                driven her to make choices she never thought she'd make.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>When her mother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, Chloe faced astronomical medical bills
                that her insurance wouldn't cover. She began skimming small amounts from Cornelius's numerous accounts,
                thinking he'd never notice. But Cornelius discovered her theft yesterday and threatened to have her
                arrested unless she repaid every penny within a week - money she doesn't have.</p>

            <div class="opportunity-section" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <button onclick="revealOpportunity(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #c79a00; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>As his personal assistant, Chloe had access to Cornelius's calendar, knew his routines, and had
                        keys to most areas of the cabin. She also knew about his meeting with the lawyer and might have
                        overheard details about the will. Her access to his correspondence means she could have learned
                        about other guests' secrets as well.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            
            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims she was organizing Cornelius's schedule for the next day. She says she was working late to catch up on emails.</p>

            
            <h3>Accusations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I saw <strong>Arthur</strong> listening at the study door.</li>
    <li>I saw <strong>Silas</strong> nervously clutching his briefcase near the guest rooms.</li>
    <li>I saw <strong>Genevieve</strong> crying in the upstairs hallway.</li>

    <li>I noticed that <strong>Blake Riley</strong> seems more concerned about protecting Eleanor's reputation than solving the murder.</li>
    <li>I noticed that <strong>Arthur Doyle</strong> was overheard muttering about "ungrateful masters".</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Has been extremely anxious and jumpy since arriving</li>
                <li>Was seen shredding documents in Cornelius's study the night before</li>
                <li>Keeps checking her phone for updates about her mother's condition</li>
                <li>Has dark circles under her eyes, suggesting sleepless nights</li>
                <li>Was overheard crying on the phone about "not having any other choice"</li>
                <li>Has been avoiding the other staff members</li>
            </ul>
