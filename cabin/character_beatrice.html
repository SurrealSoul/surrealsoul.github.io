            <h2>The Spiteful Sister</h2>
            <p>Cornelius's estranged sister. She believes the entire Crimson fortune rightfully belongs to her.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Her Secret</h3>
                    <p>She has a collection of rare poisons, a hobby she and Cornelius shared. She was seen leaving the
                        study just before the body was found.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Beatrice is Cornelius's older sister who has harbored decades of resentment over being passed over for
                the family business simply because she was born female. A brilliant chemist in her own right, she's
                spent years studying toxicology and building an impressive collection of rare poisons from around the
                world.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Beatrice firmly believes that the Crimson fortune should have been split equally between her and her
                brother, or better yet, should have gone entirely to her as the elder sibling. She's spent her entire
                life watching Cornelius squander what she considers to be her birthright, and she's finally decided to
                take matters into her own hands.</p>

                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>Her extensive knowledge of poisons makes her a prime suspect, especially given that the murder
                        weapon appears to be an exotic toxin. She was also seen leaving Cornelius's study just minutes
                        before his body was discovered, claiming she was "just saying goodbye."</p>

            </div>


            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims she was reading in the library. She says she fell asleep in the armchair around 2 AM.</p>

                    <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Openly expressed her belief that she deserves the family fortune</li>
                        <li>Has made veiled threats about Cornelius getting his "just desserts"</li>
                        <li>Was the last person seen leaving the study before the body was found</li>
                        <li>Carries a small black bag filled with mysterious vials and bottles</li>
                        <li>Has been unusually calm about her brother's death</li>
                        <li>Was overheard discussing "exotic spider venoms" with Madam Zora</li>

            <div style="display:none;">
                <h3>Accusations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I was in the library. <strong>Zora</strong> was with me.</li>
                    <li>I saw <strong>Alistair</strong> watching us from the doorway.</li>

                    <li>I noticed that <strong>"Captain" Jack</strong> was seen accepting money from Marco Varelli.
                    </li>
                    <li>I noticed that <strong>Genevieve</strong> was seen lingering outside Cornelius's study,
                        apparently
                        gathering courage.</li>
