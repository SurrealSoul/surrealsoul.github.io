            <h2>The "Forgotten" Nephew</h2>
            <p>A bumbling, awkward nephew who no one has seen in years. He seems harmless and clumsy.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>His Secret</h3>
                    <p>He's not clumsy, he's a professional cat burglar. He was seen practicing his lock-picking skills
                        on the kitchen pantry.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Timothy "Timmy" Crimson is the son of Cornelius's deceased younger brother. For years, he's cultivated
                the image of a harmless, bumbling fool who can barely tie his own shoes. In reality, he's one of the
                most skilled cat burglars on the East Coast, specializing in high-end thefts from wealthy families who
                never suspect the "simple" relative among them.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Timmy has been systematically stealing from the Crimson family for years, taking small items that
                wouldn't be missed immediately. However, Cornelius recently discovered his activities and threatened to
                turn him in to the police unless he returned everything he'd stolen. Facing prison time and the loss of
                his lucrative criminal career, Timmy decided he needed to permanently silence his uncle.</p>

            <div class="opportunity-section" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <button onclick="revealOpportunity(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #c79a00; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>Timmy's bumbling persona gives him the perfect cover - nobody watches him closely or suspects him
                        of anything more complex than accidentally breaking a vase. His professional skills in
                        lock-picking, stealth, and security systems make him capable of accessing any room in the cabin
                        without detection. He's also intimately familiar with the family's routines and blind spots.</p>

            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims he was playing video games in his room. He says he had his noise-canceling headphones on.</p>

                <div style=" display:none;">
                    <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Was seen "accidentally" testing door handles and window latches</li>
                        <li>Has been observed "clumsily" examining the security system</li>
                        <li>Carries lock-picking tools disguised as everyday items</li>
                        <li>His "accidents" always seem to happen near valuable items or important documents</li>
                        <li>Shows an unusual knowledge of the cabin's layout for someone who "rarely visits"</li>
                        <li>Was caught practicing lock-picking on the kitchen pantry</li>
                        <li>His fingerprints are notably absent from surfaces where they should be (he wears invisible
                            gloves)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                Accusations</button>
            <div style="display:none;">
                <h3>Accusations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Antoine</strong> chased me with a knife! <strong>Genevieve</strong> saw it!</li>
                    <li>I saw <strong>Lily</strong> whispering to <strong>Dr. Reed</strong>.</li>
                    <li>I went back to the kitchen at 3:00 AM for a snack. <strong>Antoine</strong> wasn't there,
                        and the
                        ovens were cold.</li>

                    <li>I noticed that <strong>Marco "The Shark" Varelli</strong> claims to be paying respects
                        despite being
                        a known enemy of Cornelius.</li>
                    <li>I noticed that <strong>Cassandra</strong> shows theatrical mannerisms that suggest
                        professional
                        acting training.</li>
                    <li>I noticed that <strong>Blake Riley</strong> shows no genuine grief about Cornelius's death.</li>
                    <li>I saw <strong>Officer Dunn</strong> dancing without his shirt on at the club! Is that allowed?
                    </li>
