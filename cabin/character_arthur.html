                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>His Secret</h3>
                    <p>Cornelius was planning to fire him without a pension after 40 years of service. He also knows the
                        location of the cabin's secret passageways.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Arthur Doyle has served the Crimson family for over four decades, starting as a young man in his
                twenties. He's witnessed every family scandal, every business deal, and every secret the Crimsons
                thought they were hiding. His loyalty has been unwavering, until now.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>After 40 years of faithful service, Arthur discovered that Cornelius planned to dismiss him without a
                pension, claiming budget cuts. The revelation that his lifelong dedication meant nothing to his employer
                has filled him with a rage that simmers beneath his professional exterior. At 65, he has no other
                prospects and no savings.</p>

                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>Arthur knows every inch of the cabin, including the secret passageways built during Prohibition.
                        He has keys to every room, knows everyone's routines, and could move through the house
                        undetected. His knowledge of the family's habits makes him the perfect killer - he knows exactly
                        how to strike without being caught.</p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims he was polishing silver in the pantry. He says he finds repetitive tasks soothing when he can't
                sleep.</p>

                        <li>Was overheard muttering about "ungrateful masters"</li>
                        <li>Has been carrying a large ring of keys, including some that guests don't recognize</li>

                        there.</li>
                    <li>I locked the cellar door. I didn't know <strong>Marco</strong> and <strong>Fiona</strong>
                        were
                        inside.</li>
                    <li>I saw <strong>Julian</strong> coming in from the porch smelling of smoke.</li>


                    <li>I noticed that <strong>Madam Zora</strong> her "predictions" seemed designed to frighten and
                        manipulate rather than entertain.</li>
                    <li>I heard a commotion and saw <strong>Lily</strong>.
                        <strong>Cassandra</strong> was there too.
