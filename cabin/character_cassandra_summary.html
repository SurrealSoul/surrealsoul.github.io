    <h1>Cassandra (ID: B6)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The "Other" Widow</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> She's not his first wife. She's an actress hired by Julian (the son) to contest the
            will and
            create chaos.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Cassandra was hired by Julian to create confusion and legal complications around
            Cornelius's will. If she
            could successfully pose as his first wife, she could contest the will and potentially delay its
            execution for years, giving Julian time to find another solution to his debt problems. She's been paid
            handsomely for her performance, but the plan requires Cornelius to be dead for it to work.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims she was visiting Cornelius's grave. She says she wanted to pay her respects
            before the storm got
            worse.</li>
    </ul>
