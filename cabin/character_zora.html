                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Her Secret</h3>
                    <p>She's a complete fraud. She's also Beatrice's (the sister's) paid accomplice, hired to "spook"
                        Cornelius into changing his will in Beatrice's favor.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Madam Zora (real name: Zelda Murphy) is a carnival fortune teller who has spent years perfecting the art
                of cold reading and psychological manipulation. She travels from town to town, setting up her crystal
                ball and tarot cards to fleece gullible clients. Her theatrical appearance and mysterious persona are
                carefully crafted to hide her true nature as a con artist.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Beatrice Crimson hired Madam Zora to psychologically manipulate Cornelius into changing his will in her
                favor. The plan was for Zora to fill Cornelius with dread about his mortality and guilt about not taking
                care of his "dear sister." However, when Cornelius saw through the charade and threatened to expose both
                women, Zora realized she needed to take more drastic action to protect herself.</p>

                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>As the hired entertainment, Madam Zora had access to most areas of the cabin and was able to
                        observe everyone's behavior. Her knowledge of psychological manipulation and her partnership
                        with Beatrice (who has expertise with poisons) could have made them a deadly team. She also had
                        private sessions with several guests, gathering information that could be useful.</p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims she was meditating in the conservatory. She says the spirits were particularly restless that
                night.</p>

                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Accusations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I was reading cards for <strong>Beatrice</strong> in the library. <strong>Alistair</strong> was
                    watching us.</li>
                <li>I saw <strong>The Twins</strong> wandering the halls holding hands.</li>
                <li>I felt a dark energy coming from <strong>Silas</strong>'s room.</li>

                <li>I noticed that <strong>Chloe Bishop</strong> was overheard crying on the phone about "not having any
                    other choice".</li>
                <li>I noticed that <strong>Cassandra</strong> her story about being Cornelius's first wife has
                    inconsistencies.</li>

                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Has been seen whispering secretly with Beatrice Crimson</li>
