    <h1>Madam Zora (ID: M8)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Fortune Teller</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> She's a complete fraud. She's also Beatrice's (the sister's) paid accomplice, hired
            to "spook"
            Cornelius into changing his will in Beatrice's favor.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Beatrice Crimson hired Madam Zora to psychologically manipulate Cornelius into
            changing his will in her
            favor. The plan was for Zora to fill Cornelius with dread about his mortality and guilt about not taking
            care of his "dear sister." However, when Cornelius saw through the charade and threatened to expose both
            women, Zora realized she needed to take more drastic action to protect herself.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims she was meditating in the conservatory. She says the spirits were
            particularly restless that
            night.</li>
