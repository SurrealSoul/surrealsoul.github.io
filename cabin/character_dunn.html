            <h2>The "Local Cop"</h2>
            <p>A man in a police uniform who arrived just before the storm. He claims he was checking on a distress
                call.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>His Secret</h3>
                    <p>He's not a cop. He's a private investigator hired by Cornelius. He discovered that "Eleanor" is
                        actually a wanted fraudster named Lorelei Vance, and he was planning to turn her in... for a
                        price.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Frank Dunn is a former police officer who lost his job due to allegations of corruption and evidence
                tampering. Since then, he's worked as a private investigator, specializing in surveillance and
                information gathering for wealthy clients who need to know what their "friends" and family are really up
                to. His police uniform is a prop that helps him gain access to places where he wouldn't normally be
                welcome.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Cornelius hired Dunn weeks ago to investigate several of his guests, suspecting that some of them were
                planning something against him. Dunn was supposed to gather evidence and report back, but when he
                learned about Cornelius's plans to cut certain people out of his will, he realized that his client's
                death might be more profitable than his continued employment.</p>

                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>Dunn's false police credentials gave him immediate access to the cabin and authority that no one
                        questioned. His investigative skills and surveillance equipment allowed him to gather detailed
                        information about everyone's secrets and motivations. As a former cop, he also knows how to
                        stage a crime scene and misdirect an investigation.</p>

                        <li>Has been taking notes and photos throughout his stay</li>
                        <li>Seems more interested in observing than investigating the murder</li>
                        <li>Carries surveillance equipment not typically issued to local police</li>
                        <li>His radio doesn't seem to connect to any actual police dispatch</li>
                        <li>Was overheard making calls about "completing the contract"</li>
                        <li>Was seen handing a manila folder to Eleanor and whispering "I know everything"</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I saw <strong>Julian</strong> smoking on the porch. <strong>Jack</strong> was nearby.</li>
                        <li>I saw <strong>Jack</strong> and <strong>Blake</strong> outside in the snow.</li>
                        <li>I saw <strong>Cassandra</strong> walking towards the family cemetery.</li>

                        <li>I noticed that <strong>Julian Crimson</strong> arrived uninvited and refused to leave when
                            asked.
                        </li>
                        <li>I noticed that <strong>Cassandra</strong> seems more interested in legal matters than in
                            mourning.
