    <h1>Beatrice Crimson (ID: F8)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Spiteful Sister</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> She has a collection of rare poisons, a hobby she and Cornelius shared. She was
            seen leaving the
            study just before the body was found.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Beatrice firmly believes that the Crimson fortune should have been split equally
            between her and her
            brother, or better yet, should have gone entirely to her as the elder sibling. She's spent her entire
            life watching Cornelius squander what she considers to be her birthright, and she's finally decided to
            take matters into her own hands.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims she was reading in the library. She says she fell asleep in the armchair
            around 2 AM.</li>
    </ul>
