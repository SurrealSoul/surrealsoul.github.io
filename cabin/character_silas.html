            <p>The man who is here to read the will. He seems nervous and is carrying a locked briefcase.</p>

                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>His Secret</h3>
                    <p>He's the only one who knows what's in the will. The will contains a new clause, added yesterday,
                        that makes him the primary beneficiary.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Silas Croft has been the Crimson family attorney for over 20 years, handling everything from business
                contracts to personal legal matters. He's always been seen as trustworthy and ethical, but recent
                financial troubles have tested his moral boundaries. He's been with Cornelius through thick and thin,
                which apparently earned him more than just legal fees.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Yesterday, just before the gathering, Cornelius called Silas with an urgent request to add a codicil to
                his will. In a moment of what Cornelius called "gratitude for faithful service," he made Silas the
                primary beneficiary, cutting out most of his family. Silas now stands to inherit the bulk of the Crimson
                fortune - but only if Cornelius dies before he can change his mind again.</p>

                    style="padding: 10px; background: #c79a00; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>As the family lawyer, Silas had private meetings with Cornelius and access to his study. He
                        arrived at the cabin early to "prepare for the reading" and was seen having intense
                        conversations with Cornelius throughout the evening. His legal knowledge would also help him
                        understand exactly how to ensure the will couldn't be contested.</p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims he was preparing documents in the guest study. He says he needed to have the will ready for the
                morning reading.</p>

                        <li>Has been evasive when asked about the contents of the will</li>
                        <li>Was overheard making a phone call about "securing his future"</li>
                        <li>Insists on reading the will immediately, despite the tragedy</li>
                        <li>Has been asking odd questions about the timeline of Cornelius's death</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I heard a commotion and saw <strong>Evelyn</strong> and the <strong>Twins</strong>.
                            <strong>Cassandra</strong> was there too.
                        </li>
                        <li>I saw <strong>Chloe</strong> trying to open the safe.</li>
                        <li>I saw <strong>Marco</strong> arguing with <strong>Fiona</strong> in the cellar.</li>

                        <li>I noticed that <strong>Arthur Doyle</strong> was seen checking and rechecking the locks on
                            all
                            doors.</li>
                        <li>I noticed that <strong>Madam Zora</strong> shows an unusual knowledge of the family's
                            private
                            affairs.</li>
