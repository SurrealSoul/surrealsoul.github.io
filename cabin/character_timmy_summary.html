    <h1>Timmy Crimson (ID: A3)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The "Forgotten" Nephew</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> He's not clumsy, he's a professional cat burglar. He was seen practicing his
            lock-picking skills
            on the kitchen pantry.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Timmy has been systematically stealing from the Crimson family for years, taking
            small items that
            wouldn't be missed immediately. However, Cornelius recently discovered his activities and threatened to
            turn him in to the police unless he returned everything he'd stolen. Facing prison time and the loss of
            his lucrative criminal career, Timmy decided he needed to permanently silence his uncle.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims he was playing video games in his room. He says he had his noise-canceling
            headphones on.</li>
    </ul>
