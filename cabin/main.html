            <h2>The Setup</h2>
            <p>19 people have gathered at the isolated mountain cabin for Cornelius Crimson's annual winter dinner party
                - a lavish tradition he's hosted for the past decade. A raging blizzard has cut off all roads and
                communication lines. You are trapped.</p>
            <p>This morning, Cornelius Crimson was found dead in his study... **an empty vial of poison clutched in his
                hand.** It looks like a suicide, but the door was locked from the *outside*. One of you is a killer.
                It's up to the rest of you to find out who before they strike again.</p>
