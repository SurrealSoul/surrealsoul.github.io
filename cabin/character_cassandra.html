            <h2>The "Other" Widow</h2>
            <p>A mysterious woman in black who claims to be Cornelius's *first* wife, who everyone thought was dead.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Her Secret</h3>
                    <p>She's not his first wife. She's an actress hired by Julian (the son) to contest the will and
                        create chaos.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Cassandra Noir is a struggling actress from Los Angeles who specializes in dramatic roles and has a
                talent for adopting different personas. When Julian Crimson contacted her through a seedy talent agency,
                she was immediately intrigued by the role of a lifetime: playing a dead woman who has returned from the
                grave to claim what's rightfully hers.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Cassandra was hired by Julian to create confusion and legal complications around Cornelius's will. If she
                could successfully pose as his first wife, she could contest the will and potentially delay its
                execution for years, giving Julian time to find another solution to his debt problems. She's been paid
                handsomely for her performance, but the plan requires Cornelius to be dead for it to work.</p>

            <div class="opportunity-section" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <button onclick="revealOpportunity(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #c79a00; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>As part of her role, Cassandra arrived at the cabin with forged documentation and a detailed
                        backstory about her "marriage" to Cornelius. Her acting skills and research into the family's
                        history make her convincing enough to fool most people, at least temporarily. Her partnership
                        with Julian gives her inside knowledge of family dynamics and potential weaknesses to exploit.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            
            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims she was visiting Cornelius's grave. She says she wanted to pay her respects before the storm got worse.</p>

            
            <h3>Accusations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I saw <strong>Silas</strong> peeking out of his room at <strong>Evelyn</strong>.</li>
    <li>I saw <strong>Jack</strong> watching me at the grave.</li>
    <li>I saw <strong>Officer Dunn</strong> trying the front door handle.</li>

    <li>I noticed that <strong>Julian Crimson</strong> has been asking other guests about the contents of the will.</li>
    <li>I noticed that <strong>Officer Dunn</strong> has been taking notes and photos throughout his stay.</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Her story about being Cornelius's first wife has inconsistencies</li>
                <li>She seems to be performing grief rather than genuinely feeling it</li>
                <li>Has been seen coordinating with Julian when they think no one is watching</li>
                <li>Her "memories" of Cornelius don't quite match up with known facts</li>
                <li>Carries what appear to be forged marriage documents</li>
                <li>Shows theatrical mannerisms that suggest professional acting training</li>
                <li>Seems more interested in legal matters than in mourning</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
