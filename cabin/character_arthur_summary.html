    <h1>Arthur Doyle (ID: G3)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Butler</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> Cornelius was planning to fire him without a pension after 40 years of service. He
            also knows the
            location of the cabin's secret passageways.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> After 40 years of faithful service, Arthur discovered that Cornelius planned to
            dismiss him without a
            pension, claiming budget cuts. The revelation that his lifelong dedication meant nothing to his employer
            has filled him with a rage that simmers beneath his professional exterior. At 65, he has no other
            prospects and no savings.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims he was polishing silver in the pantry. He says he finds repetitive tasks
            soothing when he can't
            sleep.</li>
    </ul>
