            <h2>The Personal Physician</h2>
            <p>The prim and proper doctor who was on call 24/7 to manage Cornelius's "condition."</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Her Secret</h3>
                    <p>Cornelius was blackmailing her. He knew she faked her medical license and threatened to expose
                        her.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Dr. Evelyn Reed appears to be the picture of medical professionalism - always impeccably dressed,
                carrying her black medical bag, and speaking in measured, clinical tones. However, beneath her composed
                exterior lies a web of deception that began years ago when she forged her medical credentials to escape
                poverty.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Cornelius discovered her secret through his extensive background checks and has been using it to control
                her completely. He forced her to be available 24/7, paid her below market rate, and threatened to
                destroy her life if she ever tried to leave. The stress of living under constant blackmail has pushed
                her to the breaking point.</p>

            <div class="opportunity-section" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <button onclick="revealOpportunity(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #c79a00; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>As Cornelius's personal physician, Dr. Reed had unlimited access to him and intimate knowledge of
                        his health conditions. She also had access to a wide variety of medical supplies and drugs,
                        including exotic compounds that could easily be mistaken for natural causes of death. The poison
                        vial found at the scene came from her medical bag.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            
            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims she was reviewing medical records in her room. She says she was preparing a case study on Cornelius's condition.</p>

            
            <h3>Accusations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I bumped into the <strong>Twins</strong> in the dark. It was terrifying. <strong>Silas</strong> opened his door.</li>
    <li>I saw <strong>Beatrice</strong> mixing something in a tea cup.</li>
    <li>I saw <strong>Timmy</strong> hiding under a table.</li>

    <li>I noticed that <strong>Genevieve</strong> was seen lingering outside Cornelius's study, apparently gathering courage.</li>
    <li>I noticed that <strong>Blake Riley</strong> shows no genuine grief about Cornelius's death.</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Her medical bag was found to be missing a vial of poison</li>
                <li>She's been extremely nervous and fidgety since arriving at the cabin</li>
                <li>Was seen disposing of something in the fireplace late last night</li>
                <li>Has been avoiding eye contact with other guests</li>
                <li>Claims she can't perform an autopsy due to "lack of proper equipment"</li>
                <li>Was overheard on a phone call saying "it's finally over"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
