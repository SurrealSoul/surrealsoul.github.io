    <h1>Marco "The Shark" Varelli (ID: H6)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Business Rival</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> He wasn't invited. He paid the groundskeeper to let him in. He's been trying to
            find Cornelius's
            hidden ledger to ruin his company.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Marco's business empire has been slowly crumbling since his defeat by Cornelius. He
            believes that
            Cornelius keeps a secret ledger detailing illegal business practices that could be used to destroy the
            Crimson corporation from the inside. With Cornelius dead, Marco hopes to find this ledger and use it to
            reclaim his lost fortune and reputation.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims he was making a late-night business call. He admits there was no signal, but
            says he was recording
            a voice memo.</li>
    </ul>
