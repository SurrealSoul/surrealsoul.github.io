    <h1>Julian Crimson (ID: A5)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Disowned Son</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> He is dangerously in debt to a loan shark and was heard screaming, "I'll get what's
            mine, one way
            or another!"</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Julian's debts to dangerous people have reached a critical point. He owes over $2
            million to a loan shark
            who has threatened his life. With his father's death, he hopes to inherit enough to pay off his debts
            and reclaim his place in high society. His father's will was his last hope for survival.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims he was smoking a cigarette on the back porch. He says the storm was too loud
            to hear anything
            inside.</li>
    </ul>
