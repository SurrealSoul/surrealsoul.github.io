            <h2>The Chef's Children</h2>
            <p>Chef Antoine's silent, creepy 12-year-old twins. They just watch... and whisper to each other.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Their Secret</h3>
                    <p>They stole the master key from the butler's office. They've been all over the cabin and... they
                        say they saw the killer.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Lily and Leo Dubois are Chef Antoine's precocious and unsettling 12-year-old twins. Homeschooled and
                rarely exposed to other children, they've developed an almost telepathic connection and communicate
                primarily through whispers and meaningful looks. Their father brings them to his catering jobs because
                he has nowhere else to leave them, and they've learned to entertain themselves by exploring and
                observing the adult world around them.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>The twins don't appear to have a direct motive to kill Cornelius, but their access to the master key and
                their tendency to wander the cabin unseen makes them perfect witnesses - or accomplices. Their loyalty
                to their father might drive them to help cover up his crimes, or their childish sense of justice might
                motivate them to take action against someone they perceive as having wronged their family.</p>

            <div class="opportunity-section" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <button onclick="revealOpportunity(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #c79a00; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>The twins stole the master key from Arthur's office, giving them access to every room in the
                        cabin. Their small size and quiet nature allow them to move through the building unnoticed, and
                        their habit of exploring means they've likely discovered secret passages and hiding spots that
                        adults don't know about. They also have access to their father's kitchen and all its potential
                        weapons.</p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claim they were asleep in their room. However, Genevieve claims she saw them wandering the halls holding
                hands.</p>


            <h3>Accusations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We were walking in the hall. We saw <strong>Dr. Reed (Evelyn)</strong> carrying a bag.</li>
                <li>We saw <strong>Zora</strong> talking to the air in the conservatory.</li>
                <li>We saw <strong>Antoine</strong> scrubbing red stains off his apron in the laundry room sink at 3:30
                    AM.</li>
            
    <li>I noticed that <strong>Cassandra</strong> carries what appear to be forged marriage documents.</li>
    <li>I noticed that <strong>Fiona "Foxy" Gable</strong> has been taking extensive notes about everyone's behavior.</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>They rarely speak to adults, but whisper constantly to each other</li>
                <li>Have been seen in areas where children shouldn't be able to go</li>
                <li>Possess a master key that should have been secure in the butler's office</li>
                <li>Seem to appear and disappear at will throughout the cabin</li>
                <li>Show an unsettling knowledge of adult conversations and secrets</li>
                <li>Claim to have seen the killer but refuse to speak to anyone but each other</li>
                <li>Have been drawing disturbing pictures of the adults in the cabin</li>
                <li>Their father seems unusually protective and nervous about what they might say</li>
            </ul>
