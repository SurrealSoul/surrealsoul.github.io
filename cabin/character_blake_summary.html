    <h1>Blake Riley (ID: B2)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Bodyguard</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> He is Eleanor's secret lover. He would do anything to protect her and ensure their
            future
            together.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Blake is deeply in love with Eleanor and knows about the prenuptial agreement that
            leaves her penniless
            unless Cornelius dies under unnatural circumstances. He's also been promised a substantial sum from
            Eleanor's inheritance once she receives it. His military training makes him capable of carrying out a
            perfect murder, and his devotion to Eleanor makes him willing to do anything to secure their future
            together.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims he was doing security rounds outside. He says he saw footprints in the snow
            but thought they were
            from an animal.</li>
    </ul>
