            <h2>The Widow</h2>
            <p>Cornelius's young, beautiful wife. She seems devastated, but was seen arguing with him just last night.
            </p>

            <div class="secret">
                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Her Secret</h3>
                    <p>She is actually Lorelei Vance, a wanted con artist from Chicago. Officer Dunn recognized her and
                        threatened to expose her. She didn't just kill Cornelius... she killed Dunn too.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Eleanor married Cornelius Crimson just two years ago, much to the dismay of his family who saw her as
                nothing more than a gold-digger. At 28, she's nearly 40 years younger than her deceased husband. Despite
                her outward grief, there are whispers among the guests about her true feelings toward Cornelius.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>The pre-nuptial agreement she signed was ironclad - she would receive nothing if they divorced or if
                Cornelius died of natural causes. However, if he were to die under "unnatural circumstances," she would
                inherit a substantial portion of his estate. Her secret relationship with Blake Riley, her bodyguard,
                gives her additional motivation to secure their future together.</p>

            <div class="opportunity-section" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <button onclick="revealOpportunity(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #c79a00; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>As his wife, Eleanor had unlimited access to Cornelius and his private study. She was one of the
                        last people to see him alive during their heated argument the night before his death.</p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims she was sleeping in the master bedroom. She says she took a sleeping pill at 10 PM and didn't wake
                up until the scream.</p>

                    <h3>Accusations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I was arguing with Cornelius, but <strong>Blake</strong> was right outside the door.</li>
                <li>I saw <strong>Arthur</strong> lurking in the hallway when I left the study.</li>
                <li>I saw <strong>Beatrice</strong> heading towards the library late at night.</li>

                <li>I noticed that <strong>Mr. Silas Croft</strong> has been asking odd questions about the timeline of
                    Cornelius's death.</li>
                <li>I noticed that <strong>Julian Crimson</strong> arrived uninvited and refused to leave when asked.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Was heard arguing loudly with Cornelius the night before his death</li>
                <li>Has been exchanging meaningful glances with Blake Riley</li>
                <li>Seems more concerned about the will reading than mourning her husband</li>
                <li>Was wearing a red sequined dress the night before the murder</li>
