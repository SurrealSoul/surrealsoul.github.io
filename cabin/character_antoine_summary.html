    <h1>Chef Antoine (ID: W6)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Private Chef </p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> Cornelius gave him a bad review that ruined his last restaurant. He has access to
            all the food...
            and a very sharp set of knives.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Two years ago, Cornelius dined at Antoine's restaurant and was apparently
            dissatisfied with his meal. His
            scathing review, published in a major culinary magazine, was so influential that it led to the
            restaurant's closure within months. Antoine lost his life savings, his reputation, and his dream. He's
            been forced to take private catering jobs to survive, and this weekend's event was supposed to be his
            comeback opportunity.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims he was prepping dough for the morning croissants. He says the kitchen is the
            only warm place in
            this drafty cabin.</li>
    </ul>
