    <h1>Lily (ID: Y9)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Chef's Daughter</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> She stole the master key from the butler's office. She's been all over the cabin
            and... she
            says she saw the killer.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Lily doesn't appear to have a direct motive to kill Cornelius, but her access to
            the master key and
            her tendency to wander the cabin unseen makes her a perfect witness - or accomplice. Her loyalty
            to her father might drive her to help cover up his crimes, or her childish sense of justice might
            motivate her to take action against someone she perceives as having wronged her family.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims she was asleep in her room. However, Genevieve claims she saw her wandering
            the halls alone.</li>
    </ul>
