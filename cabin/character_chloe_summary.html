    <h1>Chloe Bishop (ID: J6)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Personal Assistant</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> She was secretly siphoning money from Cornelius's accounts to pay for her mother's
            medical care.
            He found out yesterday.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> When her mother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, Chloe faced
            astronomical medical bills
            that her insurance wouldn't cover. She began skimming small amounts from Cornelius's numerous accounts,
            thinking he'd never notice. But Cornelius discovered her theft yesterday and threatened to have her
            arrested unless she repaid every penny within a week - money she doesn't have.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims she was organizing Cornelius's schedule for the next day. She says she was
            working late to catch
            up on emails.</li>
    </ul>
