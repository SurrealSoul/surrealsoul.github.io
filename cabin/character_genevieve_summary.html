    <h1>Genevieve (ID: C7)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Maid</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> She isn't a maid. She's the illegitimate daughter of Cornelius, here to claim her
            birthright. She
            has a locket with his picture in it.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Genevieve came to the cabin hoping to reveal herself as Cornelius's daughter and
            claim her inheritance.
            She took the job as a maid to get close to him and find the right moment to present evidence of their
            relationship. However, when she finally worked up the courage to confront him, he cruelly rejected her,
            claiming she was just another gold-digger trying to scam money from him.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims she was cleaning the upstairs hallway. She says she was too terrified of the
            storm to sleep.</li>
    </ul>
