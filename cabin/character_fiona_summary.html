    <h1>Fiona "Foxy" Gable (ID: D7)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Journalist</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> She believes Cornelius was responsible for her brother's "accidental" death years
            ago and is here
            for revenge, not just a story.</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Seven years ago, Fiona's younger brother Danny was killed in what was ruled an
            "accidental" fall from a
            construction site owned by Crimson Industries. Fiona has spent years investigating and believes she's
            uncovered evidence that Cornelius ordered Danny's death to prevent him from exposing safety violations.
            She came to the cabin seeking both justice and a final confession.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims she was 'investigating' the wine cellar. She admits she was actually just
            drinking a bottle of
            vintage Bordeaux.</li>
    </ul>
