            <h2>The Chef's Daughter</h2>
            <p>Chef Antoine's silent, pale daughter. She moves without sound, and sometimes... without opening doors.
            </p>

            <div class="secret">
                <button onclick="revealSecret(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #a00000; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Secret</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Her Secret</h3>
                    <p>She died of a fever three years ago. Or at least, that's what Antoine's personnel file says. She
                        doesn't breathe, and she's very cold to the touch.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Lily Dubois is... present. Antoine claims she is his daughter, but he refuses to look directly at her.
                She has no records of entering the country, and no one recalls seeing her arrive at the cabin. She
                simply
                appeared one evening in the kitchen, pale as moonlight and silent as the grave. She wanders the cabin
                at all hours, often seen in two places at once.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Lily doesn't appear to have a direct motive to kill Cornelius, but her access to the master key and
                her tendency to wander the cabin unseen makes her a perfect witness - or accomplice. Her loyalty
                to her father might drive her to help cover up his crimes, or her childish sense of justice might
                motivate her to take action against someone she perceives as having wronged her family.</p>

            <div class="opportunity-section" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <button onclick="revealOpportunity(this)"
                    style="padding: 10px; background: #c79a00; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reveal
                    Opportunity</button>
                <div style="display:none;">
                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>Lily stole the master key from Arthur's office, giving her access to every room in the
                        cabin. Her small size and quiet nature allow her to move through the building unnoticed, and
                        her habit of exploring means she's likely discovered secret passages and hiding spots that
                        adults don't know about. She also has access to her father's kitchen and all its potential
                        weapons.</p>

            </div>


            <h3>Alibi</h3>
            <p>Claims she was asleep in her room. However, Genevieve claims she saw her wandering the halls alone.</p>

                        <li>Has been seen walking through closed doors</li>
                        <li>Leaves no footprints in the snow</li>
                        <li>The temperature drops 10 degrees whenever she enters a room</li>
                        <li>Electronic devices malfunction in her presence</li>
                        <li>Claims to speak with the "other guests" who aren't there</li>
                        <li>Appears in photographs as a blur or orb</li>
                        <li>Her father seems terrified of her</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I was walking in the hall. I saw <strong>Dr. Reed (Evelyn)</strong> carrying a bag.</li>
                        <li>I saw <strong>Zora</strong> talking to the air in the conservatory.</li>
                        <li>I saw <strong>Antoine</strong> scrubbing red stains off his apron in the laundry room sink
                            at 3:30
                            AM.</li>

                        <li>I noticed that <strong>Cassandra</strong> carries what appear to be forged marriage
                            documents.</li>
                        <li>I noticed that <strong>Fiona "Foxy" Gable</strong> has been taking extensive notes about
                            everyone's behavior.</li>
                        <li>I heard rumors that <strong>Officer Dunn</strong> has been dancing in his underwear at the
                            club.</li>
