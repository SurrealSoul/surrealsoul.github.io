    <h1>"Captain" Jack (ID: Q9)</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> The Groundskeeper</p>

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secret:</strong> He's the one who sabotaged the snowplow and cut the phone lines. He was paid by
            someone... but
            who?</li>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> Jack doesn't appear to have a personal vendetta against Cornelius, but his dire
            financial situation makes
            him vulnerable to bribery. Someone paid him handsomely to ensure that no one could leave the cabin this
            weekend - cutting the phone lines and sabotaging the snowplow to create the perfect isolated crime
            scene. The question remains: who hired him, and did they tell him why?</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> Claims he was checking the generator in the shed. He says the storm was threatening
            to cut the power
            lines.</li>
    </ul>
