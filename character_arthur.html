            <h2>The Butler</h2>
            <p>The long-serving, stoic butler. He knows all the family's secrets and seems to be watching everyone.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <h3>His Secret</h3>
                <p>Cornelius was planning to fire him without a pension after 40 years of service. He also knows the location of the cabin's secret passageways.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Arthur Doyle has served the Crimson family for over four decades, starting as a young man in his twenties. He's witnessed every family scandal, every business deal, and every secret the Crimsons thought they were hiding. His loyalty has been unwavering, until now.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>After 40 years of faithful service, Arthur discovered that Cornelius planned to dismiss him without a pension, claiming budget cuts. The revelation that his lifelong dedication meant nothing to his employer has filled him with a rage that simmers beneath his professional exterior. At 65, he has no other prospects and no savings.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>Arthur knows every inch of the cabin, including the secret passageways built during Prohibition. He has keys to every room, knows everyone's routines, and could move through the house undetected. His knowledge of the family's habits makes him the perfect killer - he knows exactly how to strike without being caught.</p>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Has been unusually tense and snappy with the guests</li>
                <li>Was seen checking and rechecking the locks on all doors</li>
                <li>Appears to be watching everyone's movements very carefully</li>
                <li>Was overheard muttering about "ungrateful masters"</li>
                <li>Has been carrying a large ring of keys, including some that guests don't recognize</li>
                <li>Seems to know more about the other guests' secrets than he should</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </main>
