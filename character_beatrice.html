        <div class="character-details">
            <h2>The Spiteful Sister</h2>
            <p>Cornelius's estranged sister. She believes the entire Crimson fortune rightfully belongs to her.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <h3>Her Secret</h3>
                <p>She has a collection of rare poisons, a hobby she and Cornelius shared. She was seen leaving the study just before the body was found.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Beatrice is Cornelius's older sister who has harbored decades of resentment over being passed over for the family business simply because she was born female. A brilliant chemist in her own right, she's spent years studying toxicology and building an impressive collection of rare poisons from around the world.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Beatrice firmly believes that the Crimson fortune should have been split equally between her and her brother, or better yet, should have gone entirely to her as the elder sibling. She's spent her entire life watching Cornelius squander what she considers to be her birthright, and she's finally decided to take matters into her own hands.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>Her extensive knowledge of poisons makes her a prime suspect, especially given that the murder weapon appears to be an exotic toxin. She was also seen leaving Cornelius's study just minutes before his body was discovered, claiming she was "just saying goodbye."</p>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Openly expressed her belief that she deserves the family fortune</li>
                <li>Has made veiled threats about Cornelius getting his "just desserts"</li>
                <li>Was the last person seen leaving the study before the body was found</li>
                <li>Carries a small black bag filled with mysterious vials and bottles</li>
                <li>Has been unusually calm about her brother's death</li>
                <li>Was overheard discussing "exotic spider venoms" with Madam Zora</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </main>
