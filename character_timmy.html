            <h2>The "Forgotten" Nephew</h2>
            <p>A bumbling, awkward nephew who no one has seen in years. He seems harmless and clumsy.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <h3>His Secret</h3>
                <p>He's not clumsy, he's a professional cat burglar. He was seen practicing his lock-picking skills on the kitchen pantry.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Timothy "Timmy" Crimson is the son of Cornelius's deceased younger brother. For years, he's cultivated the image of a harmless, bumbling fool who can barely tie his own shoes. In reality, he's one of the most skilled cat burglars on the East Coast, specializing in high-end thefts from wealthy families who never suspect the "simple" relative among them.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Timmy has been systematically stealing from the Crimson family for years, taking small items that wouldn't be missed immediately. However, Cornelius recently discovered his activities and threatened to turn him in to the police unless he returned everything he'd stolen. Facing prison time and the loss of his lucrative criminal career, Timmy decided he needed to permanently silence his uncle.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>Timmy's bumbling persona gives him the perfect cover - nobody watches him closely or suspects him of anything more complex than accidentally breaking a vase. His professional skills in lock-picking, stealth, and security systems make him capable of accessing any room in the cabin without detection. He's also intimately familiar with the family's routines and blind spots.</p>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Was seen "accidentally" testing door handles and window latches</li>
                <li>Has been observed "clumsily" examining the security system</li>
                <li>Carries lock-picking tools disguised as everyday items</li>
                <li>His "accidents" always seem to happen near valuable items or important documents</li>
                <li>Shows an unusual knowledge of the cabin's layout for someone who "rarely visits"</li>
                <li>Was caught practicing lock-picking on the kitchen pantry</li>
                <li>His fingerprints are notably absent from surfaces where they should be (he wears invisible gloves)</li>
            </ul>
