        <div class="character-details">
            <h2>The Disowned Son</h2>
            <p>Cornelius's only son, cut off from the family fortune years ago. He showed up uninvited.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <h3>His Secret</h3>
                <p>He is dangerously in debt to a loan shark and was heard screaming, "I'll get what's mine, one way or another!"</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Julian was once the heir apparent to the Crimson fortune, but a series of bad business decisions and a gambling addiction led to his father cutting him off completely five years ago. Since then, he's struggled to maintain his lifestyle, resorting to increasingly desperate measures to stay afloat financially.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Julian's debts to dangerous people have reached a critical point. He owes over $2 million to a loan shark who has threatened his life. With his father's death, he hopes to inherit enough to pay off his debts and reclaim his place in high society. His father's will was his last hope for survival.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>Despite being uninvited, Julian arrived at the cabin before the storm hit. He knows the layout of the property from childhood and has been seen lurking around the study. His desperation makes him unpredictable and dangerous.</p>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Arrived uninvited and refused to leave when asked</li>
                <li>Was heard making violent threats about getting "what's his"</li>
                <li>Has been asking other guests about the contents of the will</li>
                <li>Appears nervous and jumpy, constantly checking his phone for messages</li>
                <li>Was seen near the study early in the morning before the body was discovered</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
