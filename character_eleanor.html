        <div class="character-details">
            <h2>The Widow</h2>
            <p>Cornelius's young, beautiful wife. She seems devastated, but was seen arguing with him just last night.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <h3>Her Secret</h3>
                <p>She has a secret lover in this very cabin and signed a pre-nup that left her with nothing... unless he died of "unnatural causes."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Eleanor married Cornelius Crimson just two years ago, much to the dismay of his family who saw her as nothing more than a gold-digger. At 28, she's nearly 40 years younger than her deceased husband. Despite her outward grief, there are whispers among the guests about her true feelings toward Cornelius.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>The pre-nuptial agreement she signed was ironclad - she would receive nothing if they divorced or if Cornelius died of natural causes. However, if he were to die under "unnatural circumstances," she would inherit a substantial portion of his estate. Her secret relationship with Blake Riley, her bodyguard, gives her additional motivation to secure their future together.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>As his wife, Eleanor had unlimited access to Cornelius and his private study. She was one of the last people to see him alive during their heated argument the night before his death.</p>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Was heard arguing loudly with Cornelius the night before his death</li>
                <li>Has been exchanging meaningful glances with Blake Riley</li>
                <li>Seems more concerned about the will reading than mourning her husband</li>
                <li>Was wearing a red sequined dress the night before the murder</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
