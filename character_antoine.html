            <h2>The Private Chef</h2>
            <p>A high-strung, famous chef hired for the weekend. He's furious about the blizzard and the lack of fresh ingredients.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <h3>His Secret</h3>
                <p>Cornelius gave him a bad review that ruined his last restaurant. He has access to all the food... and a very sharp set of knives.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Chef Antoine Dubois was once considered one of the finest culinary artists in the country, with a prestigious restaurant in Manhattan that attracted celebrities and food critics alike. However, his temperamental nature and perfectionist tendencies have always made him difficult to work with. His career took a devastating turn when one powerful review destroyed everything he'd built.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>Two years ago, Cornelius dined at Antoine's restaurant and was apparently dissatisfied with his meal. His scathing review, published in a major culinary magazine, was so influential that it led to the restaurant's closure within months. Antoine lost his life savings, his reputation, and his dream. He's been forced to take private catering jobs to survive, and this weekend's event was supposed to be his comeback opportunity.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>As the chef, Antoine has complete control over all the food and drink served at the cabin. He also has access to a full set of professional kitchen knives and knows how to use them with deadly precision. His knowledge of exotic ingredients and cooking techniques could easily extend to more sinister applications.</p>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Has been muttering angrily in French while cooking</li>
                <li>Was seen sharpening his knives obsessively</li>
                <li>Threw a violent tantrum when the fresh ingredients didn't arrive</li>
                <li>Has been asking specific questions about who will eat what dishes</li>
                <li>Was overheard saying "Some people deserve to choke on their words"</li>
                <li>His knife set is missing one blade - a small, precise paring knife</li>
                <li>Seems unusually interested in mushroom varieties, including poisonous ones</li>
            </ul>
