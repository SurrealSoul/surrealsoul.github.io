            <h2>The Historian</h2>
            <p>An old college "friend" of Cornelius's. He's an expert on rare artifacts, which the cabin is full of.</p>

            <div class="secret">
                <h3>His Secret</h3>
                <p>He believes Cornelius stole a priceless artifact from him decades ago and is here to steal it back. He was found picking the lock to the study.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Professor Alistair Finch taught archaeology and ancient history at Harvard for over 30 years before retiring. He and Cornelius were roommates in college and maintained a friendship built around their shared passion for collecting rare artifacts. However, their relationship soured decades ago over a disputed acquisition that has haunted Finch ever since.</p>

            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>In 1987, Finch discovered what he believed to be a genuine Mesopotamian tablet during an archaeological dig. Before he could properly document it, Cornelius "borrowed" the artifact and later claimed to have purchased it from a different source. The tablet, worth millions, has been displayed in Cornelius's private collection ever since. Finch has spent decades trying to prove it was stolen from him.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>As an old friend, Finch has been to the cabin many times and knows its layout well. His expertise in ancient artifacts means he knows exactly where Cornelius would hide his most valuable pieces. The cabin's collection room contains dozens of priceless items, including the disputed tablet that Finch considers rightfully his.</p>

            <h3>Suspicious Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Was caught with lock-picking tools outside Cornelius's study</li>
                <li>Has been examining the artifact collection with unusual intensity</li>
                <li>Brought a large, empty briefcase that could hold valuable items</li>
                <li>Shows more interest in the artifacts than in mourning Cornelius</li>
                <li>Was overheard muttering about "finally getting what's mine"</li>
                <li>Has been taking detailed notes about security measures</li>
                <li>Seems to know the value and provenance of every item in the collection</li>
            </ul>
